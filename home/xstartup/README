~/.xstartup: X application that are loaded after the wm

~/.xstartup/init: execute this through your wm, this will load all graphical applications.
    it uses xresources to make sure it is executed only once per session, so its safe to put in your wm as it will not restart
    in cases where your display manager does not reset the X server, make sure to wipe and reload xresources so this script is executed upon new logins

~/.xstartup/*.sh: executed alphabetically, make sure to send the process to the background using ``command &`` so they won't block the window manager
